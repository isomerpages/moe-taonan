Sailing is a unique sport in which our young sailors learn perseverance, problem-solving, decision-making as well as spatial awareness as they hone their sense of directions.

Through its dedicated teachers and students, Tao Nan School Sailing team provides a safe, friendly and conducive environment to the foster self-reliance and seamanship.

Our sailors gain confidence and accomplishment from being able to man their own Optimist boats, while the sport itself instils in them courage and a sense of adventure.
