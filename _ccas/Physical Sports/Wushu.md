Wushu forms part of the cultural heritage of China. It uses natural, aesthetic movements to exhibit traditional martial arts techniques. Its rich content, style, speed, meticulous attention to detail and level of difficulty ensure it to be one of the most exciting and dynamic forms of martial arts.

The trainings aim to improve whole-body fitness and traditional stance training improves strength, stamina and flexibility, whilst speed, control and balance are developed through repetitive movements that include kicking and open hand techniques.
