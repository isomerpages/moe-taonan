**Mission** <br>
To enable girls and young women to develop their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world

**Vision** <br>
We are a growing worldwide Movement ~ the voice of girls and young women who influence issues they care about and build a better world.

Guiding is a game of adventure, of observation, of general knowledge, of ideas. It is a game played by all from the young to the very old, from Brownies to Commissioners. Brownies play the game through a series of healthy and happy activities that teaches them how to lead a useful life.  

As a Brownie in guiding, she will:
* take part in worthwhile and exciting activities indoors as well as outdoors;
* wear a smart uniform;
* work and play in a group of her own (six);
* make a promise and try to live up to it;
* find happiness in helping others.
