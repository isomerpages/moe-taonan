Comics are a visual medium used to express ideas via images, often combined with text or visual information. The Comics Club is started with the vision to equip our students with a different and innovative way of expressing themselves through comics. Students will learn the necessary skills and tricks on comics drawing. They will also be taught the fundamentals of storytelling and storyboarding. Students will also be provided with an appropriate platform to exchange ideas and experiences on drawing comics.
