Tao Nan School Guzheng Ensemble was established as a CCA in year 1999. Our pupils are coached by professionals who are patient, inspiring and motivating. The current instructor has been coaching the pupils for the past 10 years. Through well-facilitated and regular group practice sessions, members gain important and beneficial life skills such as precision, perseverance, team co-operation and responsibility. They will be given opportunities to put up performances both in school and public places. Senior Members will also get to take part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF).

**Vision** <br>
The vision of the Guzheng Club is to promote appreciation for Chinese musical pieces and Chinese culture among our pupils through the mastering of the instrument, Guzheng, which is one of the oldest Chinese instruments of China.
