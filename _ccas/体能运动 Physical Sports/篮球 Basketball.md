<p>Our Basketball Team is an exciting and dynamic part of Tao Nan School,
featuring two key teams:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School Team: Competes
in National School Games (NSG) competitions.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CCA Team: Engages in
weekly training sessions to develop skills and teamwork.</p>
<p><strong>Development Pathway</strong>
</p>
<p>Students in Primary 3 and 4 start their journey in development groups,
honing their skills before being selected for the School Team in Primary
4. School Team members then compete in the Junior (Primary 4 and 5) and
Senior (Primary 6) Divisions of the NSG competitions. Those not selected
for the School Team are encouraged to continue their growth and passion
for the sport with the CCA Team.</p>
<p><strong>More Than Just a Sport</strong>
</p>
<p>At Tao Nan School, basketball is more than a sport or a co-curricular
activity—it’s a family. We focus on developing every player’s skills, knowledge,
and understanding of the game, while also emphasizing character development,
individual and team excellence, and placing team above self.</p>
<p><strong>Achievements and Excellence</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Basketball programme's effectiveness is reflected in the outstanding
results at the annual National School Games competitions and the personal
growth of each team member. In the 2024 SPSSC Basketball Championships,
our Senior Boys and Girls teams both finished as national runners-up. Our
Junior teams are competing in the pool-tier National Games 3V3 format,
building their competitive edge and applying their training in real games.</p>
