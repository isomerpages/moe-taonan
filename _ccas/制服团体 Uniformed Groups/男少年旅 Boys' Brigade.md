<p><strong>41J – Tao Nan School Company</strong>
</p>
<p>41J Company is jointly sponsored by Tao Nan School and Faith Community
Baptist Church. Aligned with the BB’s focus, 41J seeks to develop Boys
holistically with engaging activities during weekly parades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During weekly parades and training, our Boys are exposed to a variety
of courses and activities, such as foot drills. and life skill courses
such as first aid, and navigation. Through the weekly parades, it gives
the Boys opportunities to learn and display good character of obedience,
reverence, discipline and self-respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the key BB programmes organized for 41J Boys include camps that
promote teamwork and the development of life skills like outdoor cooking.
It also includes our annual BB CARES event that seeks to give the Boys
an opportunity to develop compassion and be a blessing to the community
around us through serving at an elderly activity centre in the Marine Parade
area. The other significant event for the Boys to develop ownership in
BB is BB Week where the Boys will take the responsibility to ask their
family and friends for donations to the Boys’ Brigade so that the programmes
can be well funded. The Boys also have an opportunity to ask for donations
during church services at Faith Community Baptist Church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of their 4-year commitment to BB, each Boy would have received
9 badges in total. There are also leadership roles (like Assistant Squad
Leader, Squad Leader and Lead Boy) in which the Boys in P4 &amp; P5 will
be appointed. The P6 Boys will also be nominated to receive the Gold Award
for their faithful commitment and contribution to BB. In P6, one Boy who
embodies the outstanding character deserving of a BB Boy will be selected
and nominated for the Best Boy Award, which is the highest accolade for
BB Boys in Singapore awarded by The Boys’ Brigade Headquarters (BBHQ) every
year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Boys are also given the opportunities to strive for excellence by
representing the school in various national competitions such as the BB
Adventure Quest and BB Character Quest in which teamwork and perseverance
are emphasised. Under the mentorship and guidance from the teachers and
volunteer adult leaders, the Boys go through rigorous training sessions
to give their best in these competitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a team of committed teachers, officers and our Boys, our company
has consistently excelled with its strong track record of High Distinction
in the annual JM Fraser Award for Excellence, the highest accolade for
BB Companies in Singapore awarded by BBHQ.</p>
