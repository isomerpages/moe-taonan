**Mission of the World Scout Movement:** <br>
To contribute to the education of young people through a value system, based on the Scout Promise & Laws; to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals & play a constructive role in society.

In Tao Nan, we believe that: <br>
In a world of advanced technology and rapid changes, Scouting remains steadfast to its mission of imparting important values and useful life skills that prepare our boys for the diverse challenges of life. Scouting sows the seeds of independence and aims to nurture and bring out the leader in each individual who comes to us.

In Scouting, a boy is encouraged to educate himself instead of being instructed. ~ Lord Baden Powell, Founder
