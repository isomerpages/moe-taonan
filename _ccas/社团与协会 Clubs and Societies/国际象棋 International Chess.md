During training sessions, all students are taught basic, intermediate as well as advanced skills and strategies by professional coaches. Students are taught to think and strategise carefully before they act. They will also discuss various chess moves and their resulting consequences. Thus, students can learn through chess play and apply the skills learnt in their real-life challenges by seeing connections and demonstrating values such as perseverance and respect towards their opponents. Selected members will be able to participate in the National Schools Individual Chess Championships and National Inter School Team Chess Championships organised by the Singapore Chess Federation annually.
