<p>Tao Nan School <strong>Choir CCA</strong> comprises members from Primary
3 to 6 who display a keen interest in singing and enjoy stage performances
tremendously. Our practices include learning a wide variety of songs in
many languages and of different genres. We also learn the correct breathing
techniques for singing and acquiring confidence in stage performances.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Develop our members’ love for choral singing to the fullest so that
they will continue with choral singing for years to come;</p>
<p>2. Help our members become confident, disciplined and responsible students
who have good collaborative skills.</p>
<p>We had the honour of performing at the Istana for the Singapore Bicentennial
and the opening ceremony of the Thomson East Coast Line (TEL 4).</p>
