The vision of the Chinese Dance Club is to nurture the love for dance as a performing art since young, to instil perseverance and responsibility in our dancers through weekly practices.

Our Chinese Dance Club has achieved excellent results at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. These achievements have motivated us to continue in upholding our dancers' passion for dance through performances and exposing them to various types of dancing styles.
