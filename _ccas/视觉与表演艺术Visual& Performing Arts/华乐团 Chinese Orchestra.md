道南华乐团自创办以来，一直致力于培养学生对传统华族音乐的鉴赏能力。通过学习不同的民族乐器，加强学生对华族乐器的认识，进而弘扬华族传统文化。此外，为了让学生能够获得更多的舞台经验，道南学校华乐团也积极参加校内外的演出，以及两年一度的新加坡青年节艺术展演，为学生提供平台，让学生有机会施展音乐才华，发挥团队精神。  
  
通过多年的努力，道南华乐团培育出一代又一代热爱音乐的年轻华乐演奏员，在2022年的新加坡青年艺术展演频获评委们的好评。  
  
除了提升学生的演奏技巧，道南华乐团的指导老师也致力于在团体练习中灌输道南的价值观，培养品德兼备的好学生。

The vision of the Chinese Orchestra is to promote an appreciation for Chinese music and develop a better understanding and respect for the Chinese culture through the mastering of one of the many Chinese instruments of China. We also aim to nurture the love of music as a performing art in our members since young.

Through regular group practice sessions, members are given the opportunity to gain important and beneficial life skills such as precision, perseverance and responsibility. As members become more competent in playing their instruments, the introduction of orchestral playing will help to build the pupils' self-confidence and also allow them to learn the importance of group cohesion and team cooperation.

In addition to the weekly practices, pupils are also given opportunities to perform and hone their skills through experiential performances both within and outside the school.
