华语演艺班的成立是为了给爱好说故事、朗诵等舞台表演的同学们平台在周会或学校的庆祝活动上台演出。除此之外，学生也有机会代表道南学校参加全国讲故事、朗诵、相声等比赛。演艺班的每周活动包括口语以及演艺方面的训练，让学生在面对群众表达时更具自信。

The Speech and Drama Club was established to train students who are interested in stage performances. They will also get an opportunity to take part in national competitions and school events. Trainings will be provided to help to improve students' oracy and non-verbal expressions in preparation for performances and competitions. Some of the activities include poetry recitation, cross talks, story-telling, drama as well as speech and drama.
