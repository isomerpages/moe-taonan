<p>Tao Nan School Choir comprises members from Primary 3 to 6 who display
a keen interest in singing and enjoy stage performances tremendously. Our
practices include learning a wide variety of songs in many languages and
of different genres. We also learn the correct breathing techniques for
singing and acquiring confidence in stage performances.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
<br>1. Develop our members’ love for choral singing to the fullest so that
they will
<br>continue with choral singing for years to come;
<br>2. Help our members become confident, disciplined and responsible students
who
<br>have good collaborative skills.</p>
<p>We had the honour of performing at the Istana for the Singapore Bicentennial
and the opening ceremony of the Thomson East Coast Line (TEL 4).</p>
