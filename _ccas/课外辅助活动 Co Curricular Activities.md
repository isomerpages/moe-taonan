<h4>CCA Learning Outcomes:</h4>
<p>Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) play a vital role in the holistic education
of our students.</p>
<p>Engaging in CCAs allows students to explore their interests and talents
while developing important values and competencies essential for a rapidly
changing world. CCAs also cultivate friendships among students from diverse
backgrounds as they learn, play, and grow together.</p>
<p>Active involvement in CCAs promotes social integration, strengthening
students' sense of belonging, commitment, and responsibility to their school,
community, and nation.</p>
<h4>CCA Policy:</h4>

<p>Mondays and/or Fridays are the official CCA days for all CCAs [except

<li>
<p>Students attend at least 75% of the CCA sessions in a year for his/her
participation in the CCA to be reflected in the Holistic Development Profile.</p>
