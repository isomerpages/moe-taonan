### Key Programmes / Activities
Character Development is one of the three strategic trusts of the school. Tao Nan School believes that every Taonanite must be individuals who possess a sound set of values. Thus, we plan programmes which allow our students to comprehend and display positive character and citizenship traits.

Our key drivers for Character & Citizenship Education are the
* Social-Emotional Programme
* Values Education Curriculum
* Values-in-Action Programme
* National Education Programme
* 3R Programme

These are aligned to the Character & Citizenship Education curriculum and each is customised to meet the diverse needs of our students. Our specially crafted activities fill the students with a sense of confidence and pave their way to becoming concerned citizens who are active contributors to the community and nation.
