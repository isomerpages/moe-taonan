### Key Programmes / Activities
Character Development is one of the three strategic trusts of the school. Tao Nan School believes that every Taonanite must be individuals who possess a sound set of values. Thus, we plan programmes which allow our students to comprehend and display positive character and citizenship traits.

Our key drivers for Character & Citizenship Education are the
* Social-Emotional Programme
* Values Education Curriculum
* Values-in-Action Programme
* National Education Programme
* 3R Programme

These are aligned to the Character & Citizenship Education curriculum and each is customised to meet the diverse needs of our students. Our specially crafted activities fill the students with a sense of confidence and pave their way to becoming concerned citizens who are active contributors to the community and nation.

<u> <strong> Social-Emotional Programme </strong></u> <br>
We take care of the social and emotional well-being of each student and develop their social-emotional competencies through our specially-designed programmes and individualised support.

Our Social-Emotional Programmes are:

1. Form-Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)
2. Chit-Chat Time
3. Life skills for Effective Living and Communication
4. P5-P6 Sexuality Education (SEd)

<u><strong> Values Education Curriculum </strong></u> <br>
We believe that values are both caught and taught. Thus, our programmes are anchored on our school core values and taught using explicit and implicit approaches.

Programmes:
1. Values Education Assembly Talks & Level-based Lessons
2. Growth Mindset
3. Termly Star Pupil Award

<u><strong> Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme </strong></u><br>
Taonanites are encouraged to display positive traits and internalise the values through our level and school based programmes. The level-based programmes are planned in accordance with an expanding framework and are designed in alignment with the head, heart and hands approach. Thus the students not only feel a sense of empathy for another individual but are inspired to make the community a better place for one and all.

<u><strong> National Education (NE) </strong></u><br>
NE is part of our holistic education. It aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation, and instil confidence in our nation's future. It also emphasises the need to cultivate a sense of rootedness and belonging to Singapore.

The 6 NE Messages are:
1. Singapore is our homeland; this is where we belong. <br>
    _We treasure our heritage and take pride in shaping our own unique way of life._
2. We must preserve racial and religious harmony. <br>
    _We value our diversity and are determined to stay a united people._
3. We must uphold meritocracy and incorruptibility. <br>
    _We provide opportunities for all, according to their ability and effort._
4. No one owes Singapore a living. <br>    
    _We find our own way to survive and prosper, turning challenge into opportunity._
5. We must ourselves defend Singapore. <br>    
    _We are proud to defend Singapore ourselves; no one else is responsible for our security and well-being._
6. We have confidence in our future. <br>  _United, determined and well-prepared, we have what it takes to build a bright future for ourselves, and to progress together as one nation._

In addition, they are involved in composting and the creation of an enzyme cleaner that they utilise to keep their classrooms clean while keeping the insects at bay.
