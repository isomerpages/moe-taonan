### Key Programmes / Activities

**(1) i-Train Programme** <br>
The i-train lessons are designed to meet the MOE baseline ICT skills attainment for primary schools. Each department has infused Baseline ICT skills into their curriculum so that pupils benefit from an ICT-enabled learning environment. The skills taught include Touch-Typing, Microsoft Office Skills (Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Excel) and photo-editing skills using Photoshop.

**(2) E-Learning Programme** <br>
As an effort to promote self-directed learning, the school has an E-learning programme for all pupils to enrich their learning experiences. Pupils can access the lesson resources directly or use the E-learning Portal via the link for pupils at the school's website. To encourage collaborative learning, pupils can use the forum and eduPost to communicate and collaborate with classmates and teachers in projects.

**(3) Cyber Wellness** <br>
To increase pupils’ cyber wellness competencies, the ICT Department plans and implements our programmes based on a framework developed by MOE, which the school customises to meet our pupils’ needs.

**(4) Technology Misuse** <br>
For operational purposes, the term "technology misuse" refers specifically to actions in the cyberspace which are against school cyberspace rules.
