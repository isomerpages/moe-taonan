### Key Programmes / Activities

**<u>Values Through Action in PE</u>**<br>
The teaching of values will also be integrated into the physical education curriculum. It seeks to consciously expose students to life situations, in authentic context, to facilitate perspective taking, relationship management and moral action. Structured reflection, guided discovery and facilitative questioning will help students to internalise the desired values of sportsmanship and school’s core values of respect, responsibility, perseverance, love, sincerity and integrity.
