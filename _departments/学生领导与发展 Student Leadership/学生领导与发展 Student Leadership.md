**Vision** <br>
A leader with a heart, mind and spirit

**Mission** <br>
To nurture students who demonstrate the potential to become future leaders of the nation with the desired leadership qualities and skills so that they can continue to contribute to a better society.

1) Leadership Opportunities
---------------------------

We believe that every child can be a leader and aim to provide leadership opportunities for all students. We adopt a five-level pyramidal structure to provide a different hierarchy of leadership development for our students. Student leaders hone their leadership skills through on-the-job experiences, mentoring from seniors and teachers, and/or training workshop(s).

| Level |                                                                        Leadership Opportunity                                                                       |
