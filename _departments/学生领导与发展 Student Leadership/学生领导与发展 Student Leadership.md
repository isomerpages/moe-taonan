<h3>Vision / Mission</h3>
<p><strong>Vision</strong> 
<br>A leader with a heart, mind and spirit</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong> 
<br>To nurture students who demonstrate the potential to become future leaders
of the nation with the desired leadership qualities and skills so that
they can continue to contribute to a better society.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes / Activities</h3>
<p><strong><u>Leadership Opportunities</u></strong>
<br>We believe that every child can be a leader and aim to provide leadership
opportunities for all students. We adopt a five-level pyramidal structure
to provide a different hierarchy of leadership development for our students.
Student leaders hone their leadership skills through on-the-job experiences,
mentoring from seniors and teachers, and/or training workshop(s).</p>
