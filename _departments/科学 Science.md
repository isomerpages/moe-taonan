**About the E2K Science Programme:<br>**
 The E2K Science Programme offers opportunities for students to engage in scientific investigations to discover and deepen their understanding of advanced science concepts through an inquiry approach. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help students to:  

1.Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess.

2.Gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, invention thinking and effective communication skills.

Our science teachers who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy run this programme as an after-school enrichment programme for selected students who demonstrate a strong interest, aptitude, and attitude in Science.

Spanning three years, the programme runs from Primary 4 to Primary 6: Tuesdays (1400-1530) for P4s , Thursdays (1400-1530) for P5s and P6s.
