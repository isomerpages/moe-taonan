<h3>2) Partnerships and Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>2023: TNS x OEPS Students’ Art Exhibition</strong>
</p>
<p>The 2023 TNS X OEPS Students’ Art Exhibition reinforces the collaboration
between Tao Nan School (TNS) and Opera Estate Primary School (OEPS) and
strengthens the friendship between both schools. Centred on the theme of
multicultural experiences, the exhibition showcased young artists’ creative
talents from both institutions, celebrating diversity, unity, and cross-cultural
connections. Through a diverse range of mediums like paintings and sculptures,
the artworks delve into the intricacies of multiculturalism. An additional
feature of the exhibition is our commitment to giving back through a charity
focus. We are proud to collaborate with St. Luke’s ElderCare Marine Parade
Centre as the designated beneficiary. The exhibition took place at i12
Katong from 28 October 2023 to 9 November 2023, and captivated our viewers
as they celebrated how Art is able to bridge gaps, promote dialogue, and
contribute to society.</p>

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aesthetics Week 美艺周 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>In our continued efforts to ensure all Taonanites have a holistic educational
experience, our Aesthetics Department organises Aesthetics Week where students
extend their learning about multiculturalism from Racial Harmony Day commemoration
through:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; discovering the multicultural elements of our cultural heritage
to better appreciate and understand the diverse cultures that makeup Singapore
through Art and Music;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; having the opportunity to showcase the students’ artistic
and musical skills and talents by creating, performing, and/or displaying
their creations in school to foster confidence and self-expression.</p>
<p>Students are treated to an exciting array of activities to facilitate
their discovery, and booths are set-up to showcase students’ work of several
art forms, performances, cultures and media.</p>
<p>Past activities have included Chinese Clay Animal Making, 3D Kampung House
painting, Henna bookmark designing, Chinese Blow Painting, Rangoli making,
Pebble Painting by our Art Explorers (AE), an introduction to Tongue Drums,
and Caricature Art during assembly.</p>
<p>The Roving Art Truck, courtesy of National Gallery of Singapore, also
made a grand appearance and introduced our students to many exciting activities,
local artworks and artists! We also have our very own Buskers by the Bay
