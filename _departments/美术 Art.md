### Local Artists' Series @ TNS

Art Appreciations is an integral and critical component in Art Education. With that in mind, the school initiated the Local Artists' Series to create a platform to support and bring the power of art to our children in the classroom. this collaborations with our Parents' Support Group where we enlist the help of our parent volunteers to plan and run the series. They are known to the students as the TNS Art Explorers.

Through this series, we aim to :   
* develop in our students an awareness and love for art from a young age,
* introduce to them some of the local artists,
* inspire them in art production
 
Portfolio of each artist is created and presented to the students. Through an engaging discussion, students are being stimulated in terms of their interest in the topic.
