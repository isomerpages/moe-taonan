<h3>What is PAL?</h3>
<p>PAL is a key component of the curriculum for all Primary 1 and 2 students.
The program offers practical and experiential learning in four areas:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sports &amp; Games;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outdoor Education;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visual Arts; and</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performing Arts.</p>
<p>PAL allows students to explore new interests, build character, and develop
social-emotional skills.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PAL Vision/Mission:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>PAL aims to place greater focus on non-academic programs for all Primary
1 and 2 students by offering diverse and enjoyable learning experiences
in the four domains. PAL lessons also provide an opportunity for students
and teachers to strengthen Teacher-Student Relations (TSR). This is achieved
through effective facilitation of sharing feelings and discussions on self-awareness
and relationship management through the O.R.I.D collaboration tool.</p>
<h3>How does PAL look like in Tao Nan School?</h3>
<p>At TNS, all Primary 1 and 2 students participate in Programme for Active
Learning (PAL) modules during school hours. These lesson packages are distributed
over two years and aim to give students a broad exposure to the four domains,
as well as a platform for learning and adopting school values and developing
social-emotional skills.&nbsp;</p>
