**Mission**  
 To develop confident, eloquent and empathetic communicators of the English Language

### Key Programmes / Activities

**<u>STELLAR 2.0 Curriculum </u>**<br>
 STELLAR stands for **St**rategies for **E**nglish **L**anguage **L**earning **A**nd **R**eading. It is currently being implemented from Primary 1 to 6. Rolled out since 2020, STELLAR 2.0 is an interactive literacy programme that fosters confidence in learning English using children's literature. The curriculum focusses on strengthening students’ foundation in grammar, oracy, writing and reading. It also reinforces the teaching of receptive and productive skills, namely: Reading and Viewing, Listening and Viewing, Writing and Representing, Speaking and Representing, Grammar and Vocabulary.

The learning framework for STELLAR 2.0 takes into account the principles of EL teaching and learning, CLLIPS, as spelt out in the English Language Syllabus 2020. This ensures that the language is taught in meaningful contexts, through integrating the different areas of language learning and introducing language skills and strategies in an explicit and systematic way.

The whole-part-whole approach ensures that learning is contextualised and meaningful.






The aims of STELLAR are to:  
1. strengthen reading, speaking, listening and writing skills  
2. promote a positive attitude towards reading in the foundational years through the use of well-established, learner-centred and developmentally appropriate pedagogical approaches using authentic children’s literature
