The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) provides opportunities for students to deepen their  learning in authentic situations. It seeks to foster in students the ability to integrate interdisciplinary knowledge and exhibit varied levels of metacognition. The focus of the programme is on critical thinking as this is an important skill which we use in every aspect of our lives. It also seeks to develop 21st Century Competencies through relevant, purposeful learning, extending experiences beyond the curriculum and classroom.

Programmes such as CS Unplugged and STEM are introduced to the curriculum. CS Unplugged activities are designed to aid the learning of computer science through engaging games and puzzles and physical movements. The activities introduce students to some of the underlying concepts in computer science.

**STEM** is an interdisciplinary approach to learning and development that integrates the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.   These are all areas of learning that our students need to be comfortable with to excel in the future. Through ALP STEM - Coding, students develop key skills including problem solving, computational thinking and creativity.
