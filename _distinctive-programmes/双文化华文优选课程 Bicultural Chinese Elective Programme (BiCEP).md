2007年，新加坡福建会馆响应政府的教育方针，首开先例为属下五所小学的小四生开办一项为期3年的双文化华文优选课程（BiCEP）。这项课程由属校资深华文老师精心设计，并获得专家学者的咨询与指导，目的在培养一批双语兼通，对华族文化有深刻认识的学生。  

Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan (SHHK) launched a 3-year BiCEP in its 5 affiliated primary schools in 2007 for selected Primary 4 pupils. It was designed by a team of experienced Chinese Language teachers, in consultation with Chinese Language and culture experts to develop a core group of pupils who are effectively bilingual and bicultural.

The 3-year curriculum places strong emphasis on empowering pupils to discover their Asian heritage and nurture their interests to gain a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and language.
