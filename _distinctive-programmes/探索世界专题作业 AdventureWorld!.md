AdventureWorld! (AWorld!) is a structured 5-year IP-infused programme that takes on a progressive approach to equip our students with the 21st century skills necessary for the globalised world we live in.

  

P1 to P5 students are given the opportunity to apply and display their skills learnt during AdventureWeek! (AWeek!). The students work on real world issues and/ or problems and engage in experiential learning, made possible with the support of our parents, corporate companies and external agencies such as the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).

The themes for AWeek! are as follows: <br>• P1 Responsible Pet Ownership  
• P2 Safety of Self and Others  
• P3 Family Bonding (with a focus on the needs of the elderly)  
• P4 Education and Career Awareness (with a focus on ageing population in Singapore)  
• P5 Environmental Conservation
