The year was 1906.

A group of Singaporeâ€™s richest and most powerful Chinese merchants were on their way to Thian Hock Keng temple on busy Telok Ayer Street. These men were leaders of the Hokkien clan association, or Huay Kuan, and the temple was their headquarters. These traditional Chinese men, with their long, loose robes, shaven heads and long plaits, had gathered to discuss creating a modern Chinese school for the Hokkiens and for future generations of Singapore.
