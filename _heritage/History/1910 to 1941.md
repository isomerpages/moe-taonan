With nearly 300 students crammed into the rented Siam House in North Bridge Road, Tao Nan needed a bigger, permanent home.

Tan Kah Kee (陈嘉庚) proposed that Tao Nan should get its own land and construct a new building with proper facilities. 

On 18 February 1910, Sugar baron Oei Tiong Ham (黄仲涵), the richest man in Semarang, gave $10,000 to the school at the persuasion of board member, Zhou Runxiang (周润享).

Tao Nan bought a plot of land at 39 Armenian Street and by March 1912, a new building stood ready for a new beginning.

**From Xuetang (学堂) to Xuexiao (学校)**

Like other Chinese schools in the Straits Settlements, Tao Nan was caught up in the rush to modernise when imperial rule in China ended in 1911. Its name became 道南学校 (_dao nan xuexiao_). Science and English were added to the curriculum, while pro-Emperor classics were removed. Students also learnt patriotic songs and drills.

More importantly, the influence of Mandarin grew under the leadership of Tan Kah Kee, who encouraged it among the Chinese community.

Tao Nan made history again in 1916, when it became the first modern Chinese school in the Straits Settlements to teach in Mandarin instead of Hokkien. All Mandarin teachers had to pass a language and phonetics test set by the school before they were hired. It also hired its first non-Hokkien principal, Mr Xiong Shangfu (熊尚父) from Hunan.
