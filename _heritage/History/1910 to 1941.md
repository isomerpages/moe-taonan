With nearly 300 students crammed into the rented Siam House in North Bridge Road, Tao Nan needed a bigger, permanent home.

Tan Kah Kee (陈嘉庚) proposed that Tao Nan should get its own land and construct a new building with proper facilities. 

On 18 February 1910, Sugar baron Oei Tiong Ham (黄仲涵), the richest man in Semarang, gave $10,000 to the school at the persuasion of board member, Zhou Runxiang (周润享).

Tao Nan bought a plot of land at 39 Armenian Street and by March 1912, a new building stood ready for a new beginning.
