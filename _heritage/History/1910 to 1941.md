**The Big Move**

With nearly 300 students crammed into the rented Siam House in North Bridge Road, Tao Nan needed a bigger, permanent home.

Tan Kah Kee (陈嘉庚) proposed that Tao Nan should get its own land and construct a new building with proper facilities. 

On 18 February 1910, Sugar baron Oei Tiong Ham (黄仲涵), the richest man in Semarang, gave $10,000 to the school at the persuasion of board member, Zhou Runxiang (周润享).

Tao Nan bought a plot of land at 39 Armenian Street and by March 1912, a new building stood ready for a new beginning.

**From Xuetang (学堂) to Xuexiao (学校)**

Like other Chinese schools in the Straits Settlements, Tao Nan was caught up in the rush to modernise when imperial rule in China ended in 1911. Its name became 道南学校 (_dao nan xuexiao_). Science and English were added to the curriculum, while pro-Emperor classics were removed. Students also learnt patriotic songs and drills.

More importantly, the influence of Mandarin grew under the leadership of Tan Kah Kee, who encouraged it among the Chinese community.

Tao Nan made history again in 1916, when it became the first modern Chinese school in the Straits Settlements to teach in Mandarin instead of Hokkien. All Mandarin teachers had to pass a language and phonetics test set by the school before they were hired. It also hired its first non-Hokkien principal, Mr Xiong Shangfu (熊尚父) from Hunan.

This is the very first known version of Tao Nan’s school crest, and its first school song. Very few details are available, except that the crest and song were adopted before the Japanese occupation.

From 1935 to 1939, Pan Shou (潘受), the celebrated poet and calligrapher, took over as Principal of the school and brought the school to greater heights.

(Pic on the right: Pan Shou was a cultural superstar and received awards and medals from France, ASEAN and Singapore. Students remembered their artistic principal as a caring gentleman who was respected but never feared.)

There were about 20 teachers in the school then – several were bilingual and taught both Chinese and English. The students made up of the sons and daughters of poor hawkers and labourers who walked for more than half an hour to school each day, and also the children of the wealthy, who came in cars with a personal maid. They gathered side by side in Tao Nan, ready for a good education.

However, the threat of war darkened the scene. In the late 1930s, Kuomintang members began visiting the school to recruit young men for China’s war against Japan. The first bombs fell before dawn on 8 December 1941. War had reached Singapore - and Tao Nan.
