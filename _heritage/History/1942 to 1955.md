Tao Nan remained shut throughout the war years, from 1942 to 1945.

Shortly before Singapore fell to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, all teachers in the school were dismissed with two months’ allowance. Many went into hiding. Some, like tens of thousands of other victims in Singapore, were executed by the Japanese.

The nightmare for Singapore ended on 15 August 1945, when the Japanese finally surrendered. The Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan wasted no time repairing and restoring school facilities and within two months, Tao Nan was operational again.

The school building on Armenian Street did not escape damage. The invading army looted it, wrecked the classrooms and destroyed all facilities, including the entire library. Not one book was spared. Gone too was a valuable wooden screen with exquisite carvings as shown in this picture.

Mr Lin Shiping (林史平), who taught at Tao Nan from 1939 to 1941, scribbled these words at the back of a 1940 school photograph: “Each of us went our separate ways and fled in the couple of months before the Japanese invaded Singapore. I heard later that our colleagues Wang Zhixue (王之雪) and Xue Fanghua (薛芳化) were executed in the ‘examination’ exercise.”

Former parliamentary deputy speaker Hwang Soo Jin (黄树人) was among the 1,197 schoolchildren who went back to Tao Nan that year. The classroom was not in the best condition, but there were long tables and long benches, a blackboard, duster and chalk.

Discipline was one of the greatest challenges for the school then. Three and a half years of running free and doing as they pleased had turned most students into unruly brats. Many were over-aged. It was common to see gawky adolescents aged 13 to 15, and even those in their late teens.  
  
Things were made worse by an explosion of enrolment, as a result of over-aged students returning to school along with those of proper school age. Enrolment hit a peak of 1,245 in 1946, before stabilising at about 1,100 over the next decade. The school had to run morning and afternoon sessions and the decade after the war was a period of rebuilding.
