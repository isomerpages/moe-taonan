The late 1950s and early 1960s was a period of re-orientation for Tao Nan. Its heart was now with Malaya and Singapore, not China. It was now not just a Chinese school that happened to be in Singapore, but a Singapore school for the Chinese community.

A report published in February 1956 by the All-Party Committee recommended that all schools be treated the same, resulting in a more unified national education system. For the first time, Chinese schools in Singapore were given equal treatment, including financial grants, and they would be integrated into the mainstream national system. The state funds were a great help to Tao Nan. In 1957, Tao Nan and many other Chinese schools became Government-aided schools.

When Singapore became part of Malaysia in August 1963, Malay became the national language, while English was promoted as an extremely useful working language.

Tao Nan began Malay language lessons, which replaced Chinese as the ‘national language’ or guoyu (国语). However, the biggest part of class time was still reserved for Chinese language lessons, or huayu (华语), which remained the main language of instruction for all lessons, except for English lessons.

In 1966, the school increased class time for English language lessons. Other subjects included Mathematics, Science, Ethics, Physical Education, Art and Craft, Music, and History and Geography for the Upper Primary classes.
