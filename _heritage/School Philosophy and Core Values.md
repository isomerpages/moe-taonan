In Tao Nan, every staff and pupil makes a difference.
We believe:

* Every child has the capacity to learn and each learns differently.
* Every success and failure delivers a lesson.
* In instilling good values and cultivating proper habits and the ways towards building a gracious society.
* The holistic development of our pupils is important.
* Effective learning takes place in a happy and nurturing environment.
* Learning must be meaningful for it to be internalised.

We pledge to:

* Be pupil-centric in our teaching and learning to ensure that every child learns effectively.
* Help every pupil learn from the mistakes they have made to achieve greater success.
* Be good role models for our pupils in instilling good values and cultivating proper habits.
* Provide a holistic education for our pupils in the Moral, Intellectual, Physical, Social and Aesthetic domains.
* Create a happy and nurturing environment for effective learning.
* Deliver interesting and meaningful lessons to ensure quality learning for our pupils.
