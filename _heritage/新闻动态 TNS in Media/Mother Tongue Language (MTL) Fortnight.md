*Reported in《大母指》(Thumbs Up)*

The MTL Fortnight held from 28 Mar to 8 Apr 2022 aims to create an immersive environment for learning and appreciating the Chinese Language & Culture and Bilingualism. This year’s theme was “Using Comics to Spark Creativity”. Three local comic artists were invited to share their passion, skills and the creativity involved in their comics creations. Students learned to create their own comic characters and comic pieces, as well as the essential skills to create storyboards to express themselves. The artists collaborated with our Comics Club students to create a wall mural to commemorate Tao Nan School 40th year@Marine Parade (1982-2022).
