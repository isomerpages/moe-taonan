**校长献词**

<u><strong> 爱学习 学会爱——博学笃行 厚德载物</strong></u>

“道南”二字可追根溯源至“吾道南矣”的儒家典故，显见先辈对学校茁壮发展的厚望，对弘扬中华文化的重视。“嘉庚堂”作为礼堂的命名肯定了陈嘉庚先生等先贤对学校的贡献，不仅在于筹集资金建校，更在于具前瞻性的教育决策。从西方科目的引进，到破格收录女学生和各籍贯的孩子，还有以中文取代闽南语来授课，都是开拓现代教育的里程牌。在创校一百多年后，道南学校一如既往，是一所传承优良传统同时引领时代迈进的顶尖学府。

道南学校在贯彻爱学习 学会爱的愿景时，致力于培育学生成为终身学习且品德高尚的国家栋梁。在这个人工智能发展日新月异、国际局势瞬息万变的时代，乍看之下未来是复杂且不确定，细究而言却是机遇处处甚至丰富多彩。我们未来的主人翁需要的不只是从小打好教育基础，更重要的是掌握21世纪的技能——批判及创新思维、语文和文化交流能力，资讯与科技技能等等。让学生们爱学习，能自我精进，肯突破自我，将有助于他们在崭新时代游刃有余，海阔天空中筑梦人生!

我们所仰赖的下一代，在品德修养和国家归属感方面，缺一不可。古往今来，莘莘学子遵循校训“诚毅”二字，无论是对待家庭成员或师长朋友，都带着诚恳的心去尊重与关怀他人，无论是面对任何困境或挑战，都怀着坚毅的心去正直尽责地完成使命。正所谓“修身齐家治国平天下”，作为道南学子更是不能独善其身，在强化自身的领导才能之余，也要时刻心怀祖国、放眼天下，不忘饮水思源、回馈社会。让学生们学会爱，以价值观为导向，以新加坡为所向，可让我们打造更优雅的社会、更美好的国家！

教育本是任重道远。我将本着有教无类、育人育德以及教化兴国的教育理念，勤以治校，予以学生优质的教育。相信在教育部、福建会馆、校友会和家长会的鼎力支持、家长们的通力配合，还有全体师生的全力付出，道南学校定能稳健前行、再攀高峰！

祝愿您的孩子在道南学校有一个充实愉快的学习旅程。

<u><strong> Love to Learn Learn to Love—— Lifelong Learners Future Leaders </strong></u>  

The name of the school “Tao Nan” originated from Confucian Classics which loosely translated means “spreading the philosophy southwards”. This goes to show the high expectations the school founders had and their strong emphasis on spreading the Chinese culture. The school hall which has been named after Mr Tan Kah Kee affirms the contribution of the school pioneers, not only in terms of the funds raising for school construction, but more significantly the forward looking educational decisions made. From the addition to western subjects into the curriculum, to the enrolment of students who are female or from other dialect groups, as well as the switch towards using Chinese language to replace Hokkien as the medium of instruction, can all be considered milestones in modern education. With more than a hundred years of school history, Tao Nan School continues to be a distinctive school with rich heritage and pioneering spirit. 

Tao Nan School, in moving towards the Vision of Love to Learn and Learn to Love, focuses on nurturing students into Lifelong Learners Future Leaders. In this age of exponential advancement in Artificial Intelligence and rapid development in global situation, the future may seem complex and uncertain, however, it also unveils numerous exciting possibilities and opportunities. Our students who will become future leaders, not only need a strong educational foundation from young, possessing 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking, bilingual communication through languages and culture, as well as information and technological skills, is also highly essential. To allow students to Love to Learn, be equipped to do Lifelong Learning and willing to exhibit growth mindsets for breakthrough, will help them navigate in the new era and have their dreams fulfilled!

The next generation which we pinned our hopes on, will need to have both a strong stature of moral character and a strong sense of belonging to the nation. The school Motto of “Sincerity” and “Perseverance” serves as guiding principles for Tao Nan students both past and present. Having a sincere heart to respect and care for others, regardless of family members, teachers or peers, and having a resilient mind to complete missions with integrity and responsibility, despite failures or challenges. As the Chinese saying goes “cultivate oneself before contributing to the family, nation and world”, while Tao Nan students grow in their leadership ability, they will have to develop civic literacy and global awareness, and also espouse gratitude and give back to society. To allow students to Learn to Love, to be Future Leaders of Singapore, will enable us to build a more gracious society and a better country!

Education is long-term endeavor which entails huge responsibilities. With the educational philosophy of valuing every child, emphasizing on value inculcation and embracing the value of education for the betterment of the society, I strongly believe and will strive towards providing quality education for all students. With the full support from Ministry of Education, Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan, Alumni Association and Parent Support Group, strong partnership from parents, and the high commitment of staff and students, we can work hand in hand to bring Tao Nan School to progress steadily and scale greater heights!
