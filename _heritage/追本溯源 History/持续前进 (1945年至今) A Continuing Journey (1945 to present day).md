持续前进 (1945年至今)
--------------

1945 年 9 月，日军正式投降。不到两个月，道南学校便重启开课。因战争而中断学业的大批超龄学生涌进学校，期待继续接受教育。

  

1946 年，学校开始施行上下午班制度，以容纳更多学生就读。 在接下来的几十年里，入学的学生人数趋于稳定。1957年，道南学校成为政府辅助学校，融入国家的教育体系。

  

1970 年代初期的城市重建计划使得大多数居民从市中心搬到位于郊区的住宅区，因此，道南学校于 1982 年迁至马林百列区的现址。

  

1982年，学校顺应教育改革，以英语作为主要教学媒介语。1990年，道南学校因其华校背景，在教育部推展的特别辅助计划下，成为特选小学。学校自此加强母语教育，注重传统文化及道德的传承，致力于培养双语兼优的学生。道南学校于1996 年被选为提供高才课程的学校之一，朝优质教育再跨前一步。

  

如今，道南学校已创校超过115年，成为新加坡历史上最悠久的小学之一。 学校将秉持先辈们热心教育的精神，继续为学生提供高质量、全方位的教育。

A Continuing Journey (1945 to present day)
------------------------------------------

The Japanese surrendered in September 1945 and classes resumed within two months. Education was in great demand. Students whose education had been disrupted by the war eagerly returned to school together with those of school-going age.

By 1946, classes were conducted in two sessions, morning and afternoon, to accommodate the large number of students enrolled in the school. Over the next few decades, student enrolment stabilised. Thereafter, in 1957, Tao Nan School became a government-aided school.

Urban renewal in the early 1970s saw most residents move from the city centre to suburban housing estates. Thus, after 76 years in the city, Tao Nan School moved to its current location in Marine Parade in 1982.

In 1982, English-medium education began. Mandarin and English would come to share equal emphasis over time. Tao Nan School evolved into a Special Assistance Plan School in 1990, with a dual focus on our Chinese roots and English as a common working language. Tao Nan School became the fifth school to offer the Gifted Education Programme in 1996.

Today, Tao Nan School is one of Singapore's oldest primary schools. The school continues to stand for a high-quality, well-rounded education.
