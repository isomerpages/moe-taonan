### Commemorating Racial Harmony Day 2023

This year’s theme ‘Our Multicultural Mosaic’ reflects how the different communities maintain their individual identities while also blending with others to create the distinctive cultural diversity in Singapore. Our students also learnt how the different races in Singapore use herbs and natural remedies to promote good health and well-being.
