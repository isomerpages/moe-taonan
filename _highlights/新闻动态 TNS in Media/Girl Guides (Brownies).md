Our students from Girl Guides (Brownies) attended the Girl Guides International Camp which ran from 1 to 4 June 2022 and was officially opened by President Halimah. Kwee Yi Xuan (P5L) was invited to speak about her self-published book, 'The Lotus Monarch’, and her thoughts on gender equality. She was also part of the welcome party interacting with President Halimah.
