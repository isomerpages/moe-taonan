<p>Passionate parents from the Tao Nan School (TNS) Parent Support Group
(PSG) collaborate with the school to play a supportive role. TNS PSG endeavours
to be the channel for the school and the parents to come together, to make
Tao Nan a better place for our children.</p>
<p>PSG comprises of parent volunteers whose children are currently studying
in Tao Nan. PSG provides daily support to the school in areas such as recess
and library duty, and co-organize events and workshops such as International
Friendship Day and Racial Harmony Day. We collaborate with the school to
facilitate classroom art appreciation lessons via the Art Outreach program,
and act as chaperones for field trips.</p>
<p>PSG also actively supports FamilyMatters@School and the Dads for Life
movement by organizing workshops and events to equip parents with skills
to nurture positive family relationships, and fun-filled activities to
strengthen family bonds.</p>

<br>PSG supports the school in these areas: Library, Recess and Language &amp;
Literacy support for pupils. Parents who are proficient in English should
consider availing themselves and provide support to pupils who enter Primary

<br>Art Explorer (AE) is an in-house education programme that is designed
around the academic curriculum and aims to expose students to the world
of art and promote visual literacy. You need not be trained in art as training
in both pedagogy and content for art portfolio will be provided.</p>
<p><u>Ad Hoc Duties </u>
