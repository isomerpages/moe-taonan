Tao Nan School does not recruit parent volunteers under Phase 2B of the Primary 1 (P1) Registration Exercise due to the immense support received from our Parent Support Group, Tao Nan Alumni Association, and the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan for our various school activities & programmes.

  

Please refer to MOE’s website at [https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration) for more information on P1 registration and the eligibility criteria for the different phases.
