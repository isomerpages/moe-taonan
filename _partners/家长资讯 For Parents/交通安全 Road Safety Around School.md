To ensure the safety of our students and other road users, to minimise inconvenience to the nearby residents, and to maintain free access to emergency vehicles, we would appreciate your strong support in observing the following measures:

**1\. No Parking of Vehicles when Visiting the School** <br>
a) Please use the public car parks in the vicinity, such as the HDB car parks.  
b) Due to the limited number of parking lots, car parking in the school compound is strictly for authorised personnel only.  
c) When picking up your child/ward who is sick, injured or for any other valid reason(s), please make prior arrangement(s) with the General Office so that the security officer can be informed to facilitate vehicle entry.  
  
**2\. Dropping Off or Picking Up your Child/Ward** <br>
a) Please use the designated Drop off/ Pick up point:  

i. Reporting for School <br>
If you are driving your child/ward to school in the morning, you may let your child/ward alight at School Bus Bay (designated drop-off point) **IN the school before 7.20 am** , by entering the school via the school’s main gate at Still Road South and leaving via the back gate at Marine Crescent or the front gate at Still Road South. Please observe road safety at all times and cooperate fully with the school’s traffic wardens on duty. Alternatively, you can choose to park your vehicle at the nearby HDB multi-storey carparks (see map below) and enjoy a stress-free morning bonding with your child/ward by walking him/her to school.  

ii. Dismissal <br>
**To keep the school compound safe, cars are only allowed to enter the school to pick the students up after the last school bus has left the compound. Please adhere to the timings stated in the table above. Kindly note that parking is not allowed. Please allow your child/ward to board and move off immediately.**  

To facilitate smooth flow of traffic within the bus bay, please ensure that your child/ward remembers the **colour, make and car plate number of your car** so that he/she can react promptly upon your entry into the bus bay. He/She should also be reminded to **look out for your car constantly** so that he/she can board your car without undue delay.

b) When dropping off or picking up your child/ward, we would like to seek your assistance on the following **so that we can serve our duty as considerate neighbours to the residents and concurrently reinforce the right values in our students:**  

i. When approaching school zones, drive with care, in consideration of school peak induced activities, especially the safety of students; <br>
ii. Keep to the correct lane when driving into the school to ensure road safety and smooth traffic; <br>
iii. Not to perform pick-up/drop-off activities along Marine Crescent and Still Road South; <br>
iv. Not to park/wait in a manner that would obstruct other vehicles at road intersections (e.g. carpark access, yellow-box, road junction, etc.); <br>
v. Not to stop your vehicle directly in front of the school gate as it can obstruct the traffic flow; and <br>
vi. Not to sound your vehicle horn indiscriminately in and around the school.  
  
On our part, our security officers and school personnel will be present to direct and control the traffic as well as to guide you and other approaching vehicles along the affected stretch of driveway. We seek your understanding and fullest cooperation in this matter as our students’ safety and well-being is of utmost concern.
