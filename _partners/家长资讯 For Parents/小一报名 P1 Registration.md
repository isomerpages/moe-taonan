## Procedures

### P1 Registration Procedures

**Primary 1 (P1) Registration Procedures**

The registration of children for admission to Primary One (P1) in 2026 will open from 01 July 2025 to 19 August 2025.

The dates for the different phases of registration can be found at: 
[https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/registration-phases-key-dates](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/registration-phases-key-dates)

**Online Registration via new P1 Registration Portal**

Parents can use the online P1 Registration Portal for all five phases (i.e. Phases 1, 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2C Supplementary) of the Exercise to register their child in their chosen school. 

The P1 Registration Portal will go live on 01 July 2025 and can be accessed via the MOE P1 Registration website. Parents can log in to the Portal to view the phase(s) and school(s) their child is eligible to register in, as well as register their child in their chosen school when the phase the child is eligible for opens for registration.

Parents will require a valid Singpass with 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) to login to the P1 Registration Portal. Parents are advised to set up their Singpass 2FA early and ensure that their Singpass account is valid before the commencement of the P1 Registration Exercise. Only one parent is required to login and submit the registration through the Portal.

Parents who require assistance during registration may contact the school via email ([taonan_sch@moe.edu.sg](taonan_sch@moe.edu.sg)) or telephone (6442 8307) on the respective registration days between 9.00am to 4.30pm. Information on the P1 Registration process, eligibility criteria and user guides can be found at [https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration).

Parent Volunteering
-------------------

Tao Nan School does not recruit parent volunteers under Phase 2B of the Primary 1 (P1) Registration Exercise due to the immense support received from our Parent Support Group, Tao Nan Alumni Association, and the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan for our various school activities &amp; programmes.

Please refer to MOE’s website at&nbsp;[https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration)&nbsp;for more information on P1 registration and the eligibility criteria for the different phases.
