### What is Cyber Wellness?
Cyber Wellness (CW) in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) focuses on the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace. Our curriculum aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.  
  
### 3 Principles of Cyber Wellness
These 3 main principles will guide your child's/ward’s decision-making and anchor their well-being:  
* Respect for self and others;
* Safe and responsible use; and
* Positive peer influence.

### Support at Home
To help your child/ward stay safe and have positive experiences online, you can:  
* **Organise** more outdoor activities together;
* **Activate** parental controls on your home devices;
* **Model** good digital habits for your child/ward;
* **Set ground rules** for internet use; and
* **Navigate** the internet together to understand their usage.
