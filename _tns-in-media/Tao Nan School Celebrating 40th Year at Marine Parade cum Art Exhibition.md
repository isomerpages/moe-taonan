### Tao Nan School Celebrating 40th Year @ Marine Parade (1982-2022) cum Art Exhibition



The school is celebrating its 40th year at Marine Parade and organising its annual art exhibition at i12 Katong from 15 Oct to 3 Nov 2022.  The theme is ‘The Spirit of Giving Back’ which conveys our school’s commitment to a sense of gratitude by contributing back to the school and community. It is, therefore, also a fundraising event for the Active Aging Centre at Marine Parade by Montfort Care.
