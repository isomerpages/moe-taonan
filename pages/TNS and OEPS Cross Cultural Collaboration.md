### TNS-OEPS Cross-Cultural Collaboration  

As a school approach, we partner different schools to facilitate CCA collaborations to further strengthen our school-based Character and Citizenship Education. Students from our Chinese Orchestra and Guzheng CCA engage in a cultural exchange through music with students from Opera Estate Primary School(OEPS)â€™s Angklung CCA. During the meaningful interactions, students learn how to play various instruments from their peers and appreciate diverse genres of music. New friendships are forged as they create a masterpiece which features the different musical instruments. The programme helps students develop a greater appreciation of their own culture, deepen their knowledge and understanding of the diverse cultures in Singapore and provide them with opportunities to engage with individuals of different backgrounds.
